# Active Addresses

## What is it?

The active addresses metric is an important tool to measure the level of user engagement in a given blockchain network during a specific day. This metric counts the number of wallet addresses that are involved in activities such as receiving or sending coins, or performing any type of transaction on the blockchain network.

## How is it calculated?

Calculating active addresses is relatively simple. On a specific day, each wallet address that participates in a transaction, whether sending or receiving coins, is counted as an asset. Therefore, if a user makes several transactions in a single day, all his actions will be counted as a single active address.

## How to use?

The active addresses metric is an effective way to assess the health and activity of a blockchain network. When the number of active addresses increases, it usually indicates a more dynamic network, with more users interacting and transacting. On the other hand, a decrease in the number of active addresses may suggest a reduction in network usage.
