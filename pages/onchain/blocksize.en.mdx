# Average Block Size

The average block size, measured in bytes, indicates the amount of data being processed and added to the chain in a given period.

The average block size can vary over time, depending on the amount of transactions carried out on the network on a given day. On days of high activity, when many transactions are carried out, the average block size is expected to also increase. On the other hand, on less active days, the average block size may be smaller.

This is an important indicator for network developers and maintainers as they can gauge the efficiency and ability of the blockchain to handle the increasing demand for transactions. Monitoring the average block size is essential to ensure that the network continues to function efficiently and that potential bottlenecks are identified and resolved in time.
