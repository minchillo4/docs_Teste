# Current Supply

## What is it:

The concept of Circulating Supply refers to the amount of coins or tokens of a cryptocurrency that are currently available and in circulation in the market. In other words, it is the amount of cryptocurrency units that are in the hands of investors, traders and users in general, ready to be bought, sold or used in transactions.

## How it is calculated:

The calculation of the Circulating Supply is relatively simple. To get this value, simply add up all cryptocurrency coins or tokens that have been issued and are in circulation, excluding those that are temporarily held or "locked in" through smart contracts or other forms of escrow. Only coins that are freely available in the market are counted in this metric.

## How to use:

The Circulating Supply indicator offers crucial insights for investors, traders and cryptocurrency enthusiasts. It helps these agents understand market dynamics and assess the growth potential of a given cryptocurrency based on its availability and usefulness. Some forms of use include:

**1. Liquidity assessment:** The Supply Circulante helps to understand the amount of coins available for trading, which can influence the liquidity of the cryptocurrency. Greater liquidity generally means that it is easier to buy and sell cryptocurrency without causing huge price fluctuations.

**two. Calculation of market capitalization:** The "circulating supply" is an essential factor in calculating the market capitalization of a cryptocurrency. Multiplying the current currency price by the number of units in circulation gives the market capitalization. This metric is widely used to compare the relative size of different cryptocurrencies in the market.

**3. Comparative Analysis:** Comparing the Current Supply of different cryptocurrencies allows you to understand how widely distributed they are in the market. This may be indicative of the interest and adoption of cryptocurrency by users.
