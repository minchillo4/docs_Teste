## Liquidity Profile

## What is it?

The Liquidity Profile Indicator for Bitcoin is a tool that combines Price and Open Interest data to provide a comprehensive view of Bitcoin's liquidity conditions over a four-year window.

How to use?

- **Open Interest Profile**

Open Interest refers to the sum of all open positions of a specific contract or trading instrument.

The Open Interest profile highlights the price levels of greatest interest to traders, providing a clear view of areas of intense market activity.  By mapping out the points where Open Interest is significant, investors identify regions of greater liquidity, which often act as good support and resistance levels.

- **Open Interest Delta Profile**

The Open Interest Delta reflects the daily variation in Open Interest.

Red colors indicate a decrease, while blue colors indicate an increase. This metric offers insights not only into changes in traders' positions, but also reveals the profile of these positions in relation to liquidity levels.

- **Net Delta Position Profile**

Net Delta Position shows the accumulated difference between long and short positions over a four-year period.

This indicator offers insights not only into price levels, but also into the profile of positions (longs or shorts) in a given region. A positive Net Delta indicates greater optimism on the part of traders. On the other hand, regions with a negative Net Delta suggest pessimism, pointing to price levels where there is an accumulation of short positions in that area. 

- **Buy and Sell Volume Profile**

The Buy and Sell Volume charts illustrate Bitcoin's volume profile in different price regions.

When looking at the volume profile in different price regions, green bars indicate buying volume, representing optimism and increased buying interest. On the other hand, red bars indicate greater selling volume, indicating caution and greater selling activity.

- **Total Volume Profile**

The Total Volume Profile illustrates the aggregate volume of transactions in the different price regions.

Look at the aggregate volume to understand the price regions that traders have historically been most interested in. Areas with a large aggregate volume can serve as good support and resistance levels.

- **Number of Trades Profile**

The Trades chart highlights the number of transactions made.

Observe patterns in Trades to understand the intensity of trading activity at different price levels.
