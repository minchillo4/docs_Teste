## Liquidation Levels: Heatmap

## What is it?


To understand the Liquidation Levels: Heatmap , it is essential to first understand what liquidations are.

Liquidations represent an event in which the broker closes a trader's position due to a lack of sufficient margin to keep the position open. In other words, when a trader does not have adequate funds to cover their trades, the broker makes the decision to close the position automatically.




The Liquidation Levels Heatmap indicator is a tool that can be used to identify areas where a large number of traders may be liquidated. It estimates liquidation levels by analyzing traders' leverage behavior. On the chart, the estimated liquidation levels are added to their respective price range. Strong colors in a price range indicate large liquidation zones.

## How to use it?

Large concentrations of liquidations, marked by strongly colored zones on the heat map, can be used as support and resistance zones, as large players can benefit from the opportunities created by large liquidation events.

In addition, these large concentrations of sell-offs can act as magnetic zones and often attract the price in their direction.
