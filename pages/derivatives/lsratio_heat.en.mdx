# Long Short Ratio Heatmap


## What it is


The Long Short Ratio Heatmap is an indicator that offers a visual representation of the proportion of long and short positions in different cryptocurrencies over time. This heatmap makes it possible to compare the Long Short Ratio (LSR) of various coins, allowing for a comprehensive analysis of market trends.


## How to use:


In the heatmap, each cell represents the LSR of a cryptocurrency at a specific point in time. Different colors indicate the predominance of long (buy) or short (sell) positions in each coin. This visual overview makes it easier to identify patterns and changes in investors' positions over time.




In addition, two line graphs are displayed below the heatmap: the "Average Altcoin LSR" and the "BTC LSR". The "Average Altcoin LSR" is the average Long Short Ratio of the 50 largest altcoins in terms of market capitalization, while the "BTC LSR" represents Bitcoin's Long Short Ratio. These graphs provide a direct comparison between the average of the altcoins and Bitcoin over time.


Historically, it has been observed that crossovers between the "Average Altcoin LSR" and the "BTC LSR" tend to result in strong volatility in cryptocurrency prices. This indicator is valuable for investors, offering insights into the prevailing sentiment in the market. Identifying points of possible optimism (long positions) or pessimism (short positions) can help in making strategic decisions.
