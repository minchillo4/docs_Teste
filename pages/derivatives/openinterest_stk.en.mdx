# Open Interest

## What is it?

Open Interest (OI) refers to the sum of all open positions on a specific contract or trading instrument. It is important to understand that for every buy position, there is a corresponding sell position (and vice versa). Therefore, the open interest is always made up of 50% long positions and 50% short positions.

We offer several different OI that aggregate data from different exchanges:

** - Open Interest Staked**

The Open Interest Staked indicator provides a comprehensive view of open interest, aggregating data from several exchanges. Additionally, it offers the flexibility of selecting a specific broker to analyze the unique open interest associated with it.

** - Open Interest **

This indicator provides an aggregated view of Open Interest by adding up values from different brokers. 

** - Open Interest Delta**

Open Interest Delta calculates the percentage change in OI over different periods (1D, 7D, 30D, 90D). 


## How to use

When the Open-Interest of a certain contract increases, we can infer that traders are expanding their positions in a certain contract, either buying or selling. Therefore, greater volatility is expected during this period.

Similarly, when the Open Interest decreases, we can infer that traders are reducing/closing their positions in a certain contract. It's worth noting that liquidation events reduce positions, and consequently end up reducing the open-interest of a given contract.

There are a few ways in which Open Interest can be used in your trading strategy:

**Watch for changes in the OI before important events:**

If the OI rises significantly in the days or weeks before an important news event or announcement, this indicates that traders are preparing for the event and taking positions accordingly. 

**Keep an eye on support and resistance levels.**

If Open Interest rises as an asset crosses support or resistance levels, this can signal an interest on the part of traders in that asset. This dynamic suggests the possibility that the price will continue to move in the direction of breaking through the established levels.
It is worth noting that aggregate open interest data can sometimes be manipulated by large market participants to artificially influence market sentiment. By analyzing open interest from various sources, you can reduce the risk of falling victim to manipulative tactics of this kind.
