## Market Capitalization

Market capitalization is one of the main indicators used in the cryptocurrency world to measure the value and relevance of a specific coin or token in the market. This metric is calculated by multiplying the total number of coins that have ever been mined or issued by the cryptocurrency, by the current price of each unit.

This measure offers investors and enthusiasts a more complete and comparative view on the positioning of cryptocurrencies in relation to each other. Unlike the isolated price of a coin, which can be volatile and not provide the complete picture, market capitalization takes into account both the price and the total quantity of coins in circulation.

The market capitalization value can be interpreted as an indication of the stability and relevance of a digital asset. For example, even if a cryptocurrency has a high price per unit, if its market capitalization is relatively low, it may be more susceptible to price swings and significant market impacts. On the other hand, a cryptocurrency with a larger market capitalization tends to be more stable and resilient to sudden changes in market conditions.
